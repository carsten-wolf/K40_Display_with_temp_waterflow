# K40_Display_with_temp_waterflow
K40 Laser cutter display with water flow and temperature sensor

This is a project to put some safety and automation to the K40 Laser cutter.
The Arduino checks with the flow rate sensor the water flow. If the flow is under 30 l/h Relay 2 is active.
This can activate a warning light or acoustic feedback.
Also is controls a "cooling system" for water if the water temperature is above 22째C Relay 1 is active.
You can change the value of the temperature set point with two buttons from 15째C to 25째C.
If both buttons pushed at the same time is set to the default temperature 22째C.
Relay 1 can switch a cooler or optical / acoustical feedback.
